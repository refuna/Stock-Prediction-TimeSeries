# Stock-Prediction-TimeSeries

## Overview

It is a project designed to predict stock prices using time series analysis, specifically employing the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. This project aims to analyze historical stock data to forecast future prices, enabling informed investment decisions.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Scripts to fetch historical stock price data from various financial sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to clean and normalize data, including handling missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization of stock trends, seasonality, and anomalies to gain insights into the data.
- **ARIMA Model Implementation**: Implementation of the ARIMA model to capture the underlying structure of stock price time series for forecasting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Capability to generate stock price forecasts based on current data.
